# Objectives
 To build a machine-learning model that can predict the
likelihood of a person having a heart disease
based on the given features.

# Data Dictionary
The heart CSV dataset contains 303 records and 14
columns, including the target variable. 
The features include
- age, 
- sex, 
- chest pain type (cp), 
- resting blood pressure (trestbps), 
- serum cholesterol (chol), 
- fasting blood sugar(fbs), 
- resting electrocardiographic results (restecg),
- maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), 
- exercise-induced angina (exang), 
- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak), 
- the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope), 
- number of major vessels colored by flourosopy (ca), and 
- thalassemia (thal)
- have disease or not (target)
